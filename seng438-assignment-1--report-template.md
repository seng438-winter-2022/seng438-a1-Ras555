# Introduction


This lab was designed to explore how to test a software application made by someone else
through using the software and testing it's functions to find any faults in the system.

It also explores a few different methods of testing, including exploratory testing where
the tester just plays around with the program in order to try to find faults with the system,
manual testing where the tester conducts a set of well-documented tests, and regression testing
when testing a newer version of the system. Throughout the lab, the pros and cons of each of
these testing methods are explored. 

I had not even heard of exploratory or manual testing
before the lab, but throughout the assignment I came to know and understand them through
practical application, and understand what they were good and bad at.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Exploratory testing is testing done without predocumented tests or plan. While it
is usually not very thorough due to lack of organization, the adaptibility it offers
to the tester allows testers to find faults in a program much quicker than other options
and explore the program, potentially finding faults that wouldn't have been found otherwise.

The exploratory testing that we performed on the ATM program had two main goals. First, to
confirm that the program met all requirements of the system that users require. To do this,
the tester will act as a user for the software and perform actions that normal users would.
The second goal is to check that the boundary cases work properly to restrict what the user
can do. To check this, the tester will also try to test these boundary cases through entering
values and performing actions that should not be allowed, such as entering 0 or a number that
is greater than should be allowed, and seeing if the system responds properly. This process
of trying various functions that should or should not be allowed will continue until the
tester is confident they have found most or all of the faults in the system.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Exploratory and Manual testing are very different, almost completely opposite in concept.
Manual testing is based off of well documented and thouroughly planned tests, intending to
check all of the necessary functionallities of the system. On the other hand, Exploratory
testing is completely free and flexible, without any prior documentation or a rigid structure
to follow. By allowing the tester to be flexible and try things out, it allows them to be 
adaptible and seek out flaws as they are using the system.

There are many pros and cons to either type of testing. Exploratory testing is much more
flexible than Manual, which allows the tester to play around and find faults they might
not have otherwise. Furthermore, the tests are decided in the moment, as the tester is
using the program, which allows them to have a perspective and come up with tests that
might not have come up in Manual testing since that is done from an objective, overall
view of the program rather than close up. On the other hand, because Exploratory testing
is done in the moment, theres a possibility for the tester to miss something that they
thought they had tested, or forgotten to test. This makes the testing far less thourough,
and as a result it is hard for the tester to be sure that they have found all of the bugs
in a system.

Manual testing provides a much more organized and thourough way of testing. By documenting
all of your tests first, attempting to cover all requirements and possible bugs of the program,
the actual testing is much more structured and is less likely to miss some factors due to the
testers forgetfullness or failure to see the whole picture and ignore certain functions. However,
it also has a flaw in that it is difficult to imagine that someone would be able to predict all
possible flaws from an objective view of the program, likely leaving some flaws undiscovered that
can only be discovered by playing around with the program.

In conclusion, both Manual and Exploratory testing have their own pros and cons, and are more
likely to find some flaws. The best testing method may therefore to perform best methods, as
the two methods can be used to cover up the flaws of each other and be more reliable in catching
any bugs in the system.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

During this assignments, we were faced with many problems ranging from implementing newly learnt testing techniques over to dividing 
the work load between between teammates. The application of these testing techniques was found to be very useful for increasing our skills
in developing test cases and test assessments. The assignment outline was very thorough in stating its requirements and also contained 
all the crucial information needed to complete the assignment. In addition, the group-work specifications laid out in the assignment 
made it easier for the work to be split up between all the group members. One word of critisism towards the assignment from one of our group members 
was that all though the assignment outline contained alot of useful information, it was somewhat difficult to navigate to different points 
in the assignment using the numbered points. For example, when reviewing the assignment outline, point number 5 of the regression testing 
states "Execute steps 4 and 5 (Manual Scripted Testing)" with no number being associated to point number four. In conclusion, all though the 
assignment handout was a little difficult to follow, assignment one was beneficial in increasing our understanding of the course.
