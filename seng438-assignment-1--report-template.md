# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Exploratory testing is testing done without predocumented tests or plan. While it
is usually not very thorough due to lack of organization, the adaptibility it offers
to the tester allows testers to find faults in a program much quicker than other options
and explore the program, potentially finding faults that wouldn't have been found otherwise.

The exploratory testing that we performed on the ATM program had two main goals. First, to
confirm that the program met all requirements of the system that users require. To do this,
the tester will act as a user for the software and perform actions that normal users would.
The second goal is to check that the boundary cases work properly to restrict what the user
can do. To check this, the tester will also try to test these boundary cases through entering
values and performing actions that should not be allowed, such as entering 0 or a number that
is greater than should be allowed, and seeing if the system responds properly. This process
of trying various functions that should or should not be allowed will continue until the
tester is confident they have found most or all of the faults in the system.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
